              "\"hello everyone I'm Santi and I'm currently working as an ml engineer so I'll be discussing the derivation and math behind classification which is another top ml algorithm I have covered log likelihood before in this video and I would say it's kind of a prerequisite for this video if you already know about that then without any further Ado let's start so the first thing that comes is what is the problem that we are trying to tackle here so basically we have so basically the first question always is what the data set what does the data set look like so it looks something like this as I said we'll start with the simplest form first so X1 X2 and Y so Y is basically uh either zero or one we'll be tackling binary classification first so why is either zero or one let's say looks something like this and X1 could be 1 2 3 4 maybe and X2 could be anything um. 5.9 1.0 1.1 anything so these X1 X2 are the two features and Y is our Target variable which is either zero or one and we want to predict y given X1 and X2 so now comes the graph exactly what are we trying to find here so we'll try to plot X1 X2 here X1 and X2 and then we'll try to get the uh points here so let's just say these These are the four points that we have so now what we're trying to find is this line because this line would be distinguishing these points suppose this point has y equal to um one and this point has y equal 1 this point has y equal 0 this point has y equal 0 so this is the line that we're trying to find that uh differentiates the one yal 1 from yal 0 because suppose now we have any kind of Point suppose X1 is here something and we have given X1 and X2 and we find it here and we know that this point lies on this side of the line so y will be one it's as simple as that I hope you get this so basically X1 and X2 given X1 and X2 what is our y that is our Target to find given X1 and X2 we want to find y fun fact um so logistic degression is also called classification do you know why um drop your thoughts in the comments okay coming back to this one so this line in um classification is called decision bound which is very important remember this term so what is the definition of this line this line is the maximum distance from all of the points so what do I mean by that so here actually we are tracking the distance between the points so so these these differences these are this is the DI for each point X1 I and X2 I we have this point which is Di and this di we want to maximize because we want the line such that it is it it differentiates the two uh one and zero completely okay so what is the exactly the equation that we're trying to solve here so y i given x i param this is the equation that we trying to find why are we trying to find that because if you remember correctly this is log of this um summation I = 1 to m m being the total number of data points M being the total number of data points so this equation is the log likelihood so this is is very important so that is why we trying to find this and we trying to Define this term so this is actually y i given XI parameterized by Theta this is actually the Bol distribution because either the probability we are trying to kind of find the probability of it being one or zero and b means only two values we can predict one or zero so that is why this is like similar to the Bol distribution now that we have got this out of the way we know what we're trying to find so now comes the DI let's focus on di let's get an equation for finding out Di and formalizing that so if you remember I just now said these are all di so this line this side is a positive side of the line and this side is the negative side of the line so we can either decide um so we can either decide we can decide the direction so let's just say this side of the line is positive and this side of the line is negative and then this di let's say let's denote Z as di so now this is very important to understand so listen carefully so this di it can range from positive Infinity to minus infinity so we trying to find the function so can range from positive Infinity to negative Infinity okay so now if di is zero let's say for a point the point is lying on the line so we don't know whether it's positive or negative whether it's whether it's one or zero let's just say positive one gets classified as one negative is classified as zero so if the point is on the line we don't know whether it's positive or negative we don't know whether it's one or zero so the probability is half so di equal 0 should have the probability as half we are now trying to find the constraints for for finding the function that will fit di perfectly so di0 p is equal to half what if di is positive Infinity which means that probability will be one and then di suppose it's negative Infinity then probability will be zero of getting classified as one we are finding that we are now currently thinking of p as the probability of getting classified as one this one so if it's on the line then it see and probability is half if it's Infinity which means we know for sure that it's one point is one so p is equal to 1 and if it's negative Infinity we know for sure that the point can never be one so it's B is zero so now what function fits all these conditions yes so that is the sigmoid function write this down this is the sigmoid function so what does this look like so now we going to see how the sigmo function looks like we denote It generally as G as a function of Z it would be 1 upon 1 + e^ minus Z this is a sigmoid function so let's put in the values and see if it satisfies it or not that we just now saw so if Z equals z then what is gz it is half perfect if Z is infinity what is gz gz is one perfect because because 1 by 1 + e^ minus infinity this would tend to zero so we have 1 and if Z is minus infinity then g z is equal to Z why because 1 by 1 + E power Infinity this is this tends to Infinity so 1 by Infinity is zero so now we have a function which satisfies all these points so now we have our idle function so Sigmar function is what we are going to use here before I delete this let's see the curve of the sigmoid function so this is one this is Zer this is half so at half we have um at half we at zero Z equal to Z so this is z this is gz so when Z equal to Z then we have half when Z equal to Infinity we have one and when Z equal to minus infinity we have zero so somewhat like this is the sigmoid curve remember this is very important comes in interviews comes in placements wherever jobs internships this is extremely important College exams gate exams whatever so this is very important um so now we have the sigmoid function out of our way great one down so now we'll find out the log likelihood so probability of Yi = to 1 given x i parameter Iz by Theta probability of y equal 1 given x i parameterized by Theta earli it was probability of Yi given XI parameterized by Theta because Yi was continuous in distinct case it's a little bit different so we'll take yal yal 1 and we'll take y equal 0 and we'll get the formula for these two then we'll see what to do how to combine them together that's very interesting as well we'll come to that so this is the yal 1 given XI parameterized by Theta so we know we just now found this 1 + e ^ so now what is this term what is this term so basically if you remember when I was talking about the decision boundary in binary classification is going to be a straight line obviously because we trying to divide these points this distance we trying to maximize this distance we're trying to maximize from all the points so this is a straight line so now we know for a function which is the equation of a straight line is y equal to mx + C but this is only when uh it's a it has only one feature which is X so we have here two features so then what what are we going to do so this is going to be y = to Theta 1 X1 + Theta 2 X2 + Theta 0 so we have X1 and X2 as I showed earlier in our data set and so we we will use this equation so basically what does this equation mean and how can we write this equation so I'll just play a short video here where I've talked about how we can um get this equation and write it in the form of yal theta transpose X so here it starts it's just a few seconds video so yeah so you'll understand why we are writing y equal Theta transpose X from this equation now there's a interesting way to write this so we want to write it in the form of a vector so that we have um simple equations to solve instead of this complicated equation with all the variables so now okay so now Theta how do we represent Theta so Theta would be n + one right total number of thetas will be n+ 1 because Theta 0 to Theta n for each of the X1 to xn feature so Theta Matrix would be Theta 0 Theta 1 till Theta n 1 uh n + 1 CR 1 this is our Theta Matrix and our X Matrix looks like this I already said M cross n right M being the number of data points and N being the number of features so now our y would be M so now if you can see carefully so um so Theta 0 has one this is very important try to understand this this is the trick that you will use in most of the algorithms when you're trying to find the uh any and solve using the vector formula so this is the one that we have so let's say if we had x z it would have been one so what we'll do is We'll add a column here of ones so then we'll we'll make this let's make this so this would be these are the nend features we have now we'll have another column of Wes so this becomes + one so this becomes n plus one so now you can see this is M cross1 this is M CR n + 1 n+ 1 CR 1 so we have a matrix multiplication here so if we have Theta transpose what would Theta transpose be like 1 cross n + 1 and then we'll have X so we can write X in the form of like n+ one cross M as well so that just depends on how you express X let's do that suppose we want to write X in the form of um n + 1 cross l n + 1 cross M so this is our final x uh coordinates so this would be n + 1 cross M now we have 1 cross M which is our y so we can say y transpose or we can represent it in the same way as X so in that case y would be 1 cross n so it doesn't really matter when you're trying to solve this is just the way we choose to express this formula and we choose to relate uh y and x and Theta so this would be 1 cross M so now you have this 1 cross M so you have this equation which which is like very common y equal theeta transpose X so now that we know this we know that here we are going to have since this is the probability Yi given XI parameterized by Theta so this is going to be Theta transpose XI because Yi is one that we focusing right now that is why this is the positive distance yeah so this is the positive distance that we are using Y 1 + e^ minus Theta transpose XI why are we doing that so basically what we have done means if you remember di we have written that as Theta transpose x i we don't want to get in this perpendicular thing so we are just going to take theeta transpose XI and then which is kind of like removing all the constants Yi so y equal 1 given XI parameterized by Theta is 1 by 1 e^ minus Theta transpose XI which is our distance positive distance great now the next thing is you can already guess what this is going to look like 1 by one 1 + e the power minus of minus Theta transpose X basically this is G of minus Theta transpose XI and this is this was G of theta transpose x side remember G which is the sigmoid function minus so this is going to be 1 by 1 + e to^ Theta transpose X great so now we have this out of the way it's very important to get the intuition for this because once you understand this U 90% of the problem is done so yeah so we are 90% done so now comes the gradient descent uh function and how we are going to use this log likelihood function that we just now found out um in order to find out the parameters that is Theta 1 and Theta 2 that is Theta basically how we are going to use that so we'll be using radiant descent obviously that is the only way here so now we need to formalize that so um basically maximizing log likelihood is Sim is same as minimizing the loss function so I hope you've seen the video where I've explained why this is the case and I'll reiterate it if you do not know this then it's important to know this before you proceed okay so I I'm going to assume that you know this so basically maximizing the log likelihood is the same as minimizing the loss function so now we are going to write a function for the log likelihood so what we had earlier was likelihood and of two distinct cases now we want to combine them together so this combination trying to understand this is very very very important important I cannot stress it enough okay so I'm going to use the formula directly here is not much the previous uh page where I was discussing it was the likelihood function and now this is the log likelihood just using a log this the function summation I = 1 to M log of probability of y i given x i parameterized by Theta great so now we are going to break this down such that we can accommod two cases listen very carefully so this is the first one so when y = to 1 we want to take the case when y equal to 1 here so basically our data set is divided into points such that y equal 1 and some have y equal 0 with some some points X1 and X2 so we want to find out those points which have yal 1 and take them here in the first part of the function so how are we going to indicate that we are going to use we are going to use something called an indicator variable so I is basically so let me just go into this a little um in detail so basically what is an indicator variable so suppose you have a list of functions suppose you have y here so 1 1 1 0 0 let's say this is our Y data set and we're using the indicator variable so if we do here one of y i equal 1 this means that um this means that whether Y is equal to 1 or not so this is true so this will take the value one here also it will take the value one here also it will take the value of one now here is y1 y i equal to one no so this will take the value zero and this will take the value zero so do it with me so if y i = to 1 I equal 1 2 there are five points point so then the answer would be what 1 + 1 + 1+ 0 + 0 which is going to be three so this is the this is the basic Funda of um indicator variable so now that we know indicator variable so now that we know indicator variable we can move on to the next part of this function so what is going to look like now you can guess it I think you can guess it Yi equal to0 given x i parameterized by Theta this would be indicator variable of Yi equal to Z great so whenever Yi is one we are going to use this because probability of Yi being one parameterized by Theta given x i and whenever Yi is zero we're going to use this so now this log likelihood can be expressed like this very easily now the work is almost done I can say it's 95% done so now what we want to do is just put in this value we know this value so let me just um let me just clean this up okay so now what we going to do is do the substitution and then differentiate that and equate it to zero right how we know this one probability of y i = 1 a given x i parameterized by Theta 1 by 1 + e^ minus Theta transpose X I just nowar wrote it and the other one is probability of y i = 0 given x i parameterized by Theta is 1 by 1 + e^ theeta transal x side okay so now what we going to do is substitute so this this function would look something like this this would be Yi by Yi itself because you saw that when I was showing that graph so if Yi is one then this will be one right and if it Y is zero this will be zero so we can just take Yi and then put in the function here 1 by 1 and for this one we know what is going to be you can guess it 1 minus Yi so if Y is 1 this will be zero which is what we want if Y is zero this would be one which is exactly what we want perfect so now we have 1 - Yi log of 1 by 1 + e^ th transpose x i now we have this great so now as soon as we have this our work is done so it's now 100% done so we just need to differentiate this and equate it to zero and then we'll have an equation for our thetas and we can just use that um we can use it like in gradient descent as you know so I I'll just come to that so first let's simplify this before we differentiate this minus is because I'm putting it here and this would be um this would have a minus already so we can just y i- 1 cool um yeah so now let's remember this for fora now that we have this formula then let's differentiate that Del L equal to Z I'm using Delta again because um we have multiple Dimensions um okay so now we'll differentiate this one and equate it to zero so let's differentiate we have this equation this is basically our LL Theta and this moment and we now want to differentiate this so let's do that so summation I = 1 to M - y i we differentiating with respect to Theta so this would be this would get differentiated so as we know differentiation of log X differentiation what is differentiation of log X it's one one upon X right so DDX of log X is 1x X so that is what we trying to use here and if and one more thing we're trying to use is DDX of so f of x then it is going to be DF DX upon X this is going to go down and then this will be DF upon DX so let's use that so we put this down and now we're going to differentiate this with respect to um with respect to Theta yeah so with respect to Theta what would that look like this would be zero and this would be e^ minus Theta transpose x i and this would be- XI correct yeah got it so this one this one done now the next one next one so what would this look like let's see so Yus one would be in that way keep that oh the same thing so the below it will go e to the Theta transpose XI and here it will be Theta transpose XI multipli with X I so this is the way it goes and then we're differentiating this one so e to the^ X differentiation is e to the^ X X if you know DDX of e^ X is e to^ x that we're trying to use here so e to the^ X differentiation would be this and then differentiating this with respect to Theta would be XI great so we now I've got both of these out of the way this would get plus because of two minuses now um yeah so now if you want see so this term and this term is similar so we're going to glove them together now we are going to use a trick listen very carefully otherwise you'll miss it listen very carefully I'm going to use a very simple trick very old trick in the dictionary but I'm going to use that so if you see here we have what do we have e to the^ minus x 1 plus e to the power - x right so now if I let's do that so if I convert this 1 by e to the power x upon 1 + 1 by e to^ x now get this up here we would have 1 by e^ Min - x we're multiplying with e the^ Min - x we are multiplying e the^ x so we would have e to^ x + 1 correct these two are same you agree so now we are going to use the same thing with um e^ X so e to^ x we have 1 + e to the^ X so now we are going to do is 1 by e ^ - x upon 1 by e ^ - x + 1 so now what will this be let's multiply e^ Min - x we would have 1 by 1 + e^ - x so does this does this look familiar so now if we convert this one like this we have the same denominator and we can combine these terms excellent right remember this trick this will come in handy later as well great so now you just saw what I did so I'm going to use that I'm going to convert this one into this form you will soon realize why am doing this one and not the opposite y i eus Theta transpose x i 1 + eus Theta transpose x i mtip with x i and this one I = 1 to m y i - one let's do this one so what is this going to look like 1 by 1 + e ^ minus Theta transpose x correct you got it this this is extremely a very neat trick that we use and it solves most of the problems as you just saw so now we have the same denominator we can combine these two terms so um yeah so let's do that so let's simplify so what do we have here let's see we have 1 by 1 + e^ th transpose XI and here we have Yi XI from here e^ minus Theta transpose x i we have plus y i x i from here and we have minus XI so as you can see here if you just take yxi common we have 1 plus e to the^ minus Theta transpose x i yes we are very very close to the formula that we want the simplified form so let's do that y i x i let's take that common and we have 1 + e^ minus Theta transpose x i upon 1 + e^ minus Theta transpose x i these two get canceled and this is - x i upon 1 + e^ minus Theta transpose x i we are nearing the term that we trying to find so do not forget this though it's very important this derivation is extremely important is gold pure gold so great now that we have this so we are trying to find out yeah yeah yeah we are almost we are we like literally at the end so I'll just take this one out put it here so this is going to be let's take XI out so we are going to have y i - 1 by 1 + e^ minus Theta transpose x i multip with x i does this look same does this look familiar this is what this is the sigma function correct so let's put that in here y i minus G of theta transpose x i multiplied x i summ i = 1 to n perfect this is the formula that we are that we were looking for now that we have this we know what Delta Theta LL Theta looks like and we will just now um use our gradient dist formula so remember this formula we have spent a lot of time and a lot of effort and hard work to get here so this is very very very important and if you've got this then you practically understood classification you have got it yeah perfect now uh now let's let's do that so now we are going to do the radiant desent so if you know what is gradient descent so basically gradient descent means uh I'll just repeat it like in short I have told about it I've spoken about it in my earlier videos but I'll just tell about it in short so this is where we are starting so this is our loss or our L log likelihood that we are starting okay so if we not talking about log likelihood then this would not be the curve in that case because in log likelihood we're trying to maximize it in loss function we're trying to minimize it so the curve would look something like this so here we are currently this is our log likelihood and we're trying to reach this point which is our top Target which is our maximum log likelihood function so if you have this so this is the Target that we're trying to achieve so what are we going to do simple so we are going to use our gradient descent formula Theta t + 1 so we'll initialize Theta with some random values or zero and then we'll follow this curve yeah so we are going to follow this curve so Theta t + 1 is going to be Theta T minusa Delta Theta LL Theta um sorry minus of this so practically it's plus why is this not said we are going not in the direction of the slope we going um we are going to maximize the likelihood that is why we need to move in this direction which is very important so now this is our gradient descent formula so I'll just write it out again if this is not very cleara what you just need to do is just place the function that we just now derived in here and you have it and you can follow it for as many as you want until you get convergence this is the learning rate and learning rate determines the rate of convergence and we have Theta at the end of this perfect we've literally come this far then you deserve a methal you are a genius you've understood everything and you can tackle any problem of classification now between in interview in placement in job in Gate exam in college exam anything great great amazing so now just a simple thing so basically now that we have Theta we know that the equation of the line is going to be Theta transpose X if you remember that I was using earlier Theta transpose x correct so now it's very important to find out so now we want to find out the equation of the line right so just remember one thing that we did so when I was saying that our di is Theta transpose XI right so and and G of di or G of C transpose X I would be half if di is zero remember this right so let's let's get it get that from here so 1 by 1 + e^ minus di is the transpose x i so I'm going to put this in here equal to half now solving the equation what we have it is the transpose e the^ minus thepose x i 1+ is equal to 2 so this would be 1 so now Theta transpose x i is equal to Z which is exactly the equation of the line that we're looking for and this will be the decision boundary you remember this one that I was saying earlier this is the decision boundary the for the equation of this is it transpose x i equal to zero perfect now we have got everything now given XI we can easily find out um where the line lies and based on the line we have the probability and we know on which side of the line it lies if it's a positive one then why equal to one the classified point is one and if it's on the negative side it's going to be zero great amazing now we are done um now you can tackle any problem related to classification and yeah I hope this answered all your doubts about this topic um and if you have any questions please drop them in the comments I'll try to answer them and yeah please stay tuned for new videos thank you\""
